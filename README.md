## About Sim Game

 It is a famous two player game in Graph Theory. 
 In this game, six dots are randomly placed on a plane. Players have to draw lines between disjoint points till any of the player makes a triangle. A pre joined line can not be over traced.
 
 ## Updated Sim Game
 
 I along with my friend Harsh Raj have made some changes in the traditional Sim game. Me increased the dots from 6 to 49 and we also changed some rules to make the game interesting.
 - You have to make the line from where your opponent has left.
 - Game will be over whenever any player makes a closed shape, whether its a triangle, quadrilateral or any other.
